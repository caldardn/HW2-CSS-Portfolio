# HW2-CSS-Portfolio

## Description 

This week’s challenge was to create a digital profile to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. The challenge is to show the use of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The following were the acceptance criteria of the challenge: 

•	When the portfolio is loaded my name, profile picture, links to an about me section, contact info, and my projects.

•	Links in the navigation bar will go to the corresponding section

•	The first application will be larger than the rest

•	Clicking on the images will take you to the deployed application

•	Resizing the page or viewing the site on different screens will adapt to the viewport

## Application
